CappuccinoBugs
--------------


The aim of this project is to create test applications for each issue on the cappuccino project http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/issues.

Using test applications:
------------------------
Create a clone of the repository 
"git clone git://github.com/stevegeek/CappuccinoBugs.git"
then if say the issue you wish to explore is (issuenumber) then from the CappuccinoBugs folder do:
"capp gen --force -l -f (issuenumber)"

This creates links to your local frameworks so the test application should then just work.

Adding new issues:
------------------
For each issue create a new subdirectory named after the issue number and include a test application to highlight the bug.

This can be achieved by forking the project (see GitHub for more details), then creating a new project by 
"capp gen -l (issuenumber)"  (i.e. use symlinks to the frameworks)

Add the test code then to add the new subdirectory do:
"git add (issuenumber)/"
"git commit -a"

then push to your fork with 
"git push"
